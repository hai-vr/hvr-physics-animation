HVR Physics Animation
===

This is an incomplete attempt to implement physics animation in Unity.

Physics animation is the act of applying forces to several physics objects so that they reach the pose or the joint
inertia described by a keyframed animation.

A keyframed animation can come from either an animation clip, or it could be the result of a social VR IK solver;
either local or networked.

*In this demonstration, both the local VR avatar and the NPC are physically simulated, resulting in collisions and
transfer of motion between the two.*
